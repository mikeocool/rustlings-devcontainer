# rustlings-devcontainer

The latest version of [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) doesn't natively support running it in a devcontainer or Github Codespace, so instead you can clone this repo and use it as your rustlings excersizes repo.

## To with Github Codespaces 

* Fork this repo
* Start a github codespace from your fork
* Run `rustlings` when you connect and start coding.
