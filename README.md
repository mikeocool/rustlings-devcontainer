# rustlings-devcontainer

The latest version of [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) no longer natively supports running it in a devcontainer or Github Codespace, so instead you can clone this repo and use it as your rustlings excersizes repo.

## To with Github Codespaces 

* Fork this repo
* Start a github codespace from your fork
* Run:
  ```
  cd rustlings/
  rustlings
  ```
* Open an excersize and start coding
  

You don't need to install rust or rustlings or run rustlings init, as those will all be handled as a part of setting up the devcontainer.

## TODO

* rustlings init requires pressing enter to procees
